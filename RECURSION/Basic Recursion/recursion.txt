Concept of Recursion

Recursion basically means calling a function with in a function itself.

It use to solve a bigger problem by solving small small parts .

Base Case is the condition where the recursion stops.


Instead of loops we can use recursion but we use according to the problem as what the problem needs either recursion or loops.



Call Stack
Whenever a function is called all the details are stored in a stack.


Time Complexity 

Two ways

1. Recurrence Relation 
2. Total no of recusive calls * work in each cell


Space Complexity

SC = Depth of recursion tree * memory in each call
