    In recurrsion we are keeping solving on small parts of problem which eventually solve the bigger problem .

    But here i have to remove the duplicate element 

    So if i have only one element then what should be it subset 
    like if have a set a = [1] so its subset are [1] []
    
    Basically what are doing at first i include 1 and then i exclude it
